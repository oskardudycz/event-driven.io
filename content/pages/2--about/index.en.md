From over 15 years, I'm creating software close to the business. I started my career when StackOverflow didn't exist. I'm a developer, technical leader and architect.

I like building well-designed systems, tools and frameworks that are used on production and making the people's life easier. I believe that using **Event Sourcing**, **CQRS**, and in general, **Event-Driven Architecture** is the good foundation to achieve that. Working on OSS and knowledge sharing is the huge motivation driver for me.

That's why I am:

- running workshops and training about **Event Sourcing**, CQRS and event-driven architectures.
- co-maintainer of [Marten](https://martendb.io/) OSS library that allows implementing **Event Sourcing**.
- providing Event Sourcing in real-world samples and tutorials in [my Github Repository](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore)
- share my knowledge on the blog of how to create good, modular applications pragmatically.

My main projects:

- 🐉 [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/) - The stream database built for Event Sourcing.
- 🐿️ [Marten](https://martendb.io/) - .NET Transactional Document DB and Event Store on PostgreSQL.
- ⚡ [Event Sourcing in .NET](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore) - Practical samples, self-paced kits and tutorials of how to build Event-Sourced applications in .NET.
- ⚡ [Event Sourcing in Node.js tutorials](https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NodeJS) - Samples and materials similar as for .NET, but written in more functional approach.
- 🏗 [Architecture Weekly](https://github.com/oskardudycz/ArchitectureWeekly) - weekly set of links and resources to boost your knowledge and developer experience.
- 🔧 [WebApi with .NET Core](https://github.com/oskardudycz/WebApiWith.NETCore) - Samples and resources of how to create well-designed WebApi in .NET.
- 👁️ [GoldenEye](https://github.com/oskardudycz/GoldenEye) - The CQRS flavoured framework that will speed up your WebAPI and Microservices development.
