**I'm always saying that the Marten community is one of the things that keeps me doing Open Source and staying in the .NET community.** It's really welcoming and supportive. Of course, there are [distinctions to the rule](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oskardudycz_my-favourite-type-of-oss-users-u-how-activity-7135568854675537920-XN9Z?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), but they're rare enough.

At the time of writing, we have almost 1000 users on our Discord. It's a nice place to be, not only for bug reports but also for discussions around architecture and software design. If you're not yet there, [come and join us!](https://discord.gg/w5wGvDpy7E).

**So we're trying to stay close to our users, and I think we're doing a decent job on that, but there's something we could do better**: understanding the specific use cases, being more proactive, and learning what they precisely do. Also, getting more case studies on the domain products they built.

**That should help to:**
- keep closer human-to-human relationships with our users,
- building features more suitable for their needs,
- providing better services, also [paid ones](https://www.jasperfx.net/support-plans/) to help them deliver business value faster with better resiliency. 
- showing other new people what can be done with Marten and who uses it.

So, if you're our user, I have a small request: **could you fill out this short survey?**

Thank you in advance! 

We'd really appreciate that. I genuinely believe it should help you and us get even better synergy.

**We're also planning to reach out to the people who filled out the survey to get on the video call and learn from each other even better.**

Cheers!

Oskar


p.s. **Ukraine is still under brutal Russian invasion. A lot of Ukrainian people are hurt, without shelter and need help.** You can help in various ways, for instance, directly helping refugees, spreading awareness, putting pressure on your local government or companies. You can also support Ukraine by donating e.g. to [Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/pl/donate/ukraine), [Ukraine humanitarian organisation](https://savelife.in.ua/pl/donate/) or [donate Ambulances for Ukraine](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-to-save-the-lives-of-civilians-in-a-war-zone).
