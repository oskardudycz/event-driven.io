**I realised that I could do more to help you and other folks.**

I've been sharing online content for free in the last few years on this blog, [self-paced kits](/en/introduction_to_event_sourcing/), and [OSS works](https://github.com/oskardudycz). 

I know that it helped many folks, but...

But I still feel I could do more and provide structured material to take you through the learning journey fully. 

**Of course, you can order a [workshops](/en/training) or consultancy to get that.** Yet, that's not scaling enough, I have limited time, and I'd like to share my experience with you and more people. Giving also space for taking time and learning on your own with the preferred pace.

**I prepared a short survey; I know that your time is precious, but it'll help me a lot if you share your feedback with me:**

**Thank you a lot in advance!**

I'll also extremely appreciate resharing it with your friends or leaving comments here!

Cheers!

p.s. **Ukraine is still under brutal Russian invasion. A lot of Ukrainian people are hurt, without shelter and need help.** You can help in various ways, for instance, directly helping refugees, spreading awareness, putting pressure on your local government or companies. You can also support Ukraine by donating e.g. to [Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/pl/donate/ukraine), [Ukraine humanitarian organisation](https://savelife.in.ua/pl/donate/) or [donate Ambulances for Ukraine](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-to-save-the-lives-of-civilians-in-a-war-zone).
