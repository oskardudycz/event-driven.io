**Did you ever get an offer that someone will pay you for what you are currently doing as a hobby?** What would be your decision if that would mean leaving the project that you liked? A team of people that you built from scratch being its first member? Leave the company department that you created?

**I got such offer over a month ago. I accepted it.**

Yesterday I started my new job. **I'll be a full-time DevAdvocate at [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/)!**

**OK but, who is DevAdvocate?** 

To be true - I can't precisely tell you that. However, I can tell you how I imagine it. What will be in my duties:
- Explaining Event Sourcing, building awareness of its existence among programmers. Broadening the niche, explaining not only why it is worth using it, but keeping it pragmatic.
- Providing helpful content - blog posts, examples and tutorials. Trying to show the big picture, how to integrate Event Sourcing with other patterns and tools,
- Creating tools, maybe also libraries that will be helpful for developers. [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/) is not a library (like, e.g. [Marten](https://martendb.io/)) - it is a database for events (*so ummm, you know event store*). Its API is relatively low-level, it may be worth to create OSS tools that will reduce cognitive load and boilerplate,
- Communication with developers and being their advocate to the project team. For example, [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/) had a bit of a false start with revolutionary version 20. It had so much breaking change that people had problems with migration. It could have been mitigated with communication or different release plans. 
- Working on the documentation,
- live coding, podcasting and other ideas that will pop out.

**OK, but how did I get here?**

For many developers Event Sourcing is like a Nessie, most of them have heard of it, but not so many saw it. I was one of them. **I started my journey with Event Sourcing over four years ago**. Practical journey - before that I mostly read books, which shouldn't count. Why? Because there was not a lot of them showing how to apply Event Sourcing practically. When my colleague said that "well, you're doing financial system then Event Sourcing sounds like a good match" - I was curious. Then I was thrilled, as finally, I was able to use the pattern known from the books. I used [Marten](https://martendb.io/) library. First steps were hard. I was irritated. I started to get doubts if that's something for me.

I'm not the type of person to easily give up. Step by step, I understood more and more. Then making mistakes and learning from them, I started to get better vision. I noticed that [Marten](https://martendb.io/) have some missing pieces, and I began to send pull requests. I also began to interact with users on Gitter channel because I saw that they had the same struggles as I did.

**Two years ago, Jeremy D. Miller invited me to become the co-maintainer. I'm currently responsible for the Event Sourcing part and second committer**. My current attitude is summed up best by Greg Young quote: *"When you start modelling events, it forces you to think about the behaviour of a system. As opposed to thinking about the structure of the system"*.

I also started to give more often talks on conferences, local meetups and webinars. I created the popular repository "Event Sourcing in .NET" that contain lots of samples, exercises and materials for doing Event Sourcing in .NET - https://github.com/oskardudycz/EventSourcing.NetCore/. I'm trying to continuously provide practical examples to show that Event Sourcing is much easier and much more realistic than many folks believe.

TLDR - I hustled because I felt passionate about the practical aspect and what one can achieve with Event Sourcing and in general with Event-Driven Design.

**OK, so that was my story, but how did I get the job?**

I sent an email for the offer I saw by accident on Twitter. Looking at it, I thought - this is a job for me. However, I didn't send the application right away. Why? Because I felt that it was going to be a conflict of interest with [Marten](https://martendb.io/). Plus, I wasn't looking for a new job because the current one was a decent one. Yet then I realized that maybe I don't have to give up [Marten](https://martendb.io/). I knew that there are people in [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/) who work at [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/) daily and contributes to other OSS Event Sourcing tools.

I didn't want to be a renegade - I'm a loyal person. I'm thankful for the chance I got from Jeremy D. Miller. 

Luckily Mat McLoughlin was fine with that and Jeremy saw no problem with it.

Conclusion - sometimes, a person lives in his imaginary world and tries to create problems that do not exist. It's usually better not to assume.

Few zoom calls and email later, I got an offer, and **yesterday the revolution began!**

**I am thrilled** because for me it is a great chance to work with people like Mat and Alexey Zimarev. Not always one gets the opportunity to follow the passion. I'll be working on a great product, gaining more knowledge and even more opportunities to share it!

I think that having a perspective of knowing different event stores, understanding the view of the everyday developer struggles I'll be able to present and share Event Sourcing from different angles. Do it pragmatically, as I like the most. At least - that's the plan!

So don't be surprised when someone knocks on your door and asks *"Hello. Do you want to talk about Event Sourcing?"*

Was it an easy decision? In theory, it was a no-brainer.
In practice, it is difficult to leave the company that you have grown into. I spent almost ten years in Euvic. The company that during that time changed its name from LGBS, and grew into one of the largest Polish programming companies. I helped build the Wroc≈Çaw branch. I rose from the senior dev into the Technical Leader and Architect. What's the most important I made a team with whom I had a great time working.

Well. Life is the art of choices. For me, it was an offer that I couldn't reject. 
Is it the right decision? I believe so!

**Please keep your fingers crossed and don't afraid to reach me!** I will be grateful for that!
